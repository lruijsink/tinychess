TinyChess: light-weight JavaScript chess UI

The goal of this project is to make a simple and reusable chess UI that works across all different platforms.

Major features left to implement:
- PGN support
- Move input through standard IO
- Stand-alone version of the chess board for reuse

Still a heavy work in progress.
